# wolfpack

## Project setup
Welcome to the Frontend Wolves app!
The leader of the pack wants us to create a web application to track all the wolves in the
pack. Task is to build a web based frontend for
this API which implements all the required functionalities for the app.
This app should have the following functionalities, in the future more functionalities
may be added:
- It should be possible to list all the wolves including some basic personal information
such as their name, gender and birthdate. 
- Furthermore it should be possible to add,
remove and update wolves in this list.
Packs
- Wolves like hanging out in packs, in our app weâ€™d like an option to create packs to which
we can add wolves. 
- Packs consist of a name, location and one or more wolves.
- Furthermore, sometimes we want to remove wolves from a pack again. 
- The app should be able to display a list of packs and the wolves which are in them. 
- Bonus: Add a mapshowing all the packs. 


Notes:
- The API is available at https://join.wolfpackit.nl/api/documentation
